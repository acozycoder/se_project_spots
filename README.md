**Intro**
  
The Spots landing page is a component of a social media web application. The application allows users to create a profile and upload images to share with others. Users have the opportunity to add titles to their photos before uploading.

**Technologies & Techniques Utilized**

* **Flexbox**

The flex property is generously used throughout the layout of this design. It can be seen in every section of the page. The profile provides a look into how flexboxes can be placed inside of one another.

* **Grid**
 
The gallery seen on the page was created by displaying an untitled list with the grid property.

* **Hover animations**

There are three hover animations with smooth transitions and cursor effects applied on the page: the edit profile button, the new post button, and the like button.

*Screenshots below were taken from the original Figma project breif.*

* **Responsive web layout**

The page is responsive using flexable sizing measurments and media queries. The layout of the profile and image sizes adjust to accomadate smaller screen sizes.

Users are able to upload their own images and change their profile name and description. All forms also go through a validation process, allowing for more accurate and functional submissions.
